# JavaScript shell scripts for Daily Shells

This contains JavaScript related shell scripts to bootstrap JavaScript projects such as Node, React or both. Options for TypeScript are also available.

You can just clone this, execute ```chmod +x scripts/*``` inside the cloned directory and add that scripts directory to the PATH...

**... but there is a *much easier* way!**

Read on:

## Daily Shells plugin i.e. automated setup

The Daily Shells plugin feature will clone, install, chmod the scripts and have that directory in the PATH, all of these done automatically!

If you still do not have Daily Shells installed in your environment, follow the instructions at http://stroparo.github.io/ds/

Then with a new terminal emulator opened after having just installed Daily Shells, just run:

```dsplug ds-js```

Voil√°, this plugin's scripts will be ready to be executed!
